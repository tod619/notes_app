# notes_app

## Description

Allows a user to create read update and delete notes using local storage. The notes can be written in either as standard text or markdown through the use of marked.js.
The notes are stored in local storage. Any notes that are created are saved on local storage, and when the user closes the browser the notes persist. When the users clicks on the trash icon the note is deleted from the DOM and also from local storage. To edit a note the user can click on the edit icon which opens the textarea. Clicking on the edit icon again saves the note to local storage. By default a new note is editable on creation and the edit btn needs to be clicked to save the note.
